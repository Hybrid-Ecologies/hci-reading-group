## Acquiring and Organizing Readings
* *Pay Wall*. Many research articles exist behind pay walls. As a UC Berkeley student, you have access to many of these articles, however, **you'll need to be accessing them from a Berkeley IP address**.
* *Bibliography manager* Zotero or Mendeley are commonly used. Zotero offers a valuable Chrome plugin that allows you to download papers and metainformation from a single click.
